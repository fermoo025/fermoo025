- ⚡ Fun fact: I resolved Elementor Page-Loading. When first loading Elementor page, sometimes it tooks long or gets stucked. In my net, it was stucked. I examined the source and they download Google fonts newly.
- In one css, there were 161 fonts but many of them were duplicates. So I inserted removing duplicates and checking existances code. Following this, my Elementor started. I think many of teoubles are caused by this.
- I searched into Google and found that the loading problem have continued until now. I think error on loading Google Fonts is the main source of troubles.-
